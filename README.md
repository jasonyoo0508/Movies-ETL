# Movies-ETL


## Purpose

Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis.
We need to create & analyze new data, clean it up, transform it, and load the data for visible outputs. We will be refactoring the code to create one function that takes Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the Movie Lens rating data and add the ETL process.

## Stages

Extraction stage :
Create & Read the data in the Python, using csv & json through PD.

Transformation:
The raw data is transformed into usable dataset. During the transformation, data cleaning would be required as cleaning missing values, nun values, corrupted datas. Then we would have to compile and filter the dataset.

Load:

Create a connection to the database from the Python to load the final data output.
